# Dubious Activity Detection

## Synopsis

Every household, organization and government around the world today, employs some form
of video surveillance technology to enhance security. The footage generated from these closed
circuit cameras can be used for analysing suspicious crowd behaviour in public places.
This should be done due to it's potentially harmful nature which could at worse escalate to life threatening scenarios.

This project becomes relevant with the
increase in antisocial activities on a day to day basis. It also eases the workload on humans since
automated monitoring of footage is much more easier and efficient than when manually done.
It could also drastically reduce the workforce necessary for such a task thus justifying the need
to automate the same.This
project proposes an approach to analyse crowds and identify suspicious activities of moving
people. Once a suspicious behaviour occurs, we track this object within the camera’s field of view. The system we
intend to develop would classify input video feed into three classes:

1. Dubious
1. Potentially dubious
1. Safe

The architecture of the system is based on convolutional neural networks.
